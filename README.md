# Clear

### An ultralight PHP *non*-framework

## Core design philosophy

1. PHP's processors already have routers built in, stop writing routers in PHP.
2. PHP is already a templating language, stop using another one on top of it.
3. Stop auto-loading dozens or hundreds of unused files for every request.
4. Lets get back to the old days where adding a new page to our websites was as easy as creating ONE FILE.
	* You don't have to define a route for the new page!
	* You don't have to write a page controller if you don't want to!
	* You don't have to write a database model if you don't want to!
	* You don't even have to include `clear` if you don't want to!
