# Clear

### An ultralight PHP *non*-framework

## Core design philosophy

1. PHP already has a router built in, stop writing new ones.
2. Stop auto-loading dozens or hundreds of unused files for every request.
3. PHP is already a templating language, don't throw another one in the mix.
4. Lets get back to the old days where adding a new page to our websites was as easy as creating ONE FILE.
	* You don't have to write a page controller if you don't want to!
	* You don't have to write a database model if you don't want to!
	* You don't even have to include `clear` if you don't want to!
